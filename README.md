Takes user input of name and other details - creates 2 Word documents from them (agreement and welcome)

### Setup:

Download the project .zip folder. Then check your Python version (this script was tested with Python 3.10.8) then download python from here "https://www.python.org/downloads/" (using version 3.10.8)

Install requirements.txt with pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

The setup.ps1 script is a work in progress but it seemed like it worked correctly on my PC (I alreaday had the requirements installed, but it created the venv and activated it/etc.)
